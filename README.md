# PSES Docs

This README aims to show you a clear overview about the different packages / relevant files in the PSES Workspace and to give you a quick access to their documentation.

## Essential
The following ROS-package and information material make up the core of the PSES and are essential to work with the cars at our lab. 
 * [ROS workshop](https://github.com/tud-pses/pses_docs/blob/master/PSES%20Einf%C3%BChrung%20ROS.pdf): Slides with information and examples for ROS beginners as well as basic information about the PSES packages.
 * [VirtualBox image](todo): Download this image if you desire to have a virtual machine of Lubuntu 16.04 with ROS-Kinetic and our development environment working out of the box. **ToDo**: Requirements and link. 
 * [Installation guide](https://github.com/tud-pses/pses_docs/tree/master/installation-scripts): If you don not want to use a virtual machine or you had any hardware compatibility problem while trying that, then you also have the oportunity to follow this guide and install our development environment from scratch on your computer (requires Ubuntu 16.04 or Lubuntu 16.04).
 * [PSES UcBridge wiki](https://github.com/tud-pses/pses_ucbridge/wiki) The package ucBridge is the heart of the PSES workspace because it enables you to communicate with the car's microcontroller in an easy way through the "ROS world". Hence it is essential to read this wiki, in order to understand how to get sensor values and send commands to the microcontroller.
 * [Hello World example](https://github.com/tud-pses/pses_helloworld): After reading the UcBridge wiki, we highly recommend to continue with this "hello world" example.
